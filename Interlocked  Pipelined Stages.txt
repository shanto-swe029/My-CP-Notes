Interlocked Pipelined Stages(IPS)

MIPS 
- Microprocessor without IPS
- 32 registers, 32-bit each
- uniform length instructions
- RISC load-store architecture

* How instructions are represented in MIPS processors?
* Instruction Encoding

* What is pipelining?
- An inmplementation technique whereby multiple instructions are overlapped in execution.
- It takes advantage if parallelism that exists among the actions needed to execute an instruction.
- Pipelining is the key implementation technique to make fast CPU's.

* Characteristics of pipeline
* Pipelining in circuits
